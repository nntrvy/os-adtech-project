# Mai Linh + iDOOH Failure Analysis & Vietnam Taxi Screen Regulations

**Date:** 11.12.25
**Session:** Research on why taxi screens failed in Vietnam

---

## Executive Summary

In June 2018, Mai Linh partnered with iDOOH (Singapore) to deploy 5,000 in-car advertising screens. The initiative collapsed when iDOOH went bankrupt. This document analyzes the failure and extracts lessons for our Xanh SM strategy.

**Key Finding:** The failure was due to **execution and economics**, NOT regulations. Passenger-facing screens are legal in Vietnam.

## Root Causes of Failure

### 1. Mai Linh Was a Sinking Ship

| Year | Mai Linh Situation |
|------|-------------------|
| 2017 | Revenue dropped **30%** vs pre-Grab years |
| Oct 2017 | Total debts: **VND 180 billion ($7.92M)** |
| 2018 | Fighting for survival against Grab/Uber |
| 2018 | No resources to support screen deployment |

**Lesson:** iDOOH partnered with a company that couldn't pay its own bills, let alone maintain advertising screens.

### 2. Unit Economics Didn't Work

| Cost Factor | Problem |
|-------------|---------|
| Hardware | $100-200/tablet × 5,000 = $500K-1M upfront |
| 4G data | $1.5-3/screen/month ongoing |
| Maintenance | Theft, damage, driver neglect |
| Fill rate | Vietnam CPM too low to cover costs |

**Regional CPMs were insufficient** to fund hardware + operations when iDOOH bore all costs.

### 3. Driver Incentive Problem

From original article: drivers received "monthly subsidies" for equipment management.

**Reality:**
- Drivers saw screens as a burden, not benefit
- No real incentive to protect hardware
- Tablets got stolen, broken, turned off
- No accountability for screen uptime

### 4. Advertiser Demand Mismatch

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| SMEs didn't know about it | No self-serve platform |
| Agencies wanted scale | 1,000 screens = too small |
| No targeting data | No ride data integration |
| No attribution | Couldn't prove ROI |

### 5. iDOOH Overextended

iDOOH was simultaneously expanding in:
- Singapore (ComfortDelGro - 3,000 taxis)
- Philippines (Micab - 5,000 planned)
- Indonesia
- Malaysia
- Vietnam (Mai Linh - 5,000 planned)

**Too many markets, not enough capital or execution capacity.**

## Vietnam Taxi Advertising Regulations

### Key Finding: NO REGULATORY BARRIER

| Regulation | Requirement |
|------------|-------------|
| License needed? | **No** - Just notify authorities 15 days before |
| Approval time | 5 days (silence = approved) |
| Content restrictions | No tobacco, alcohol 15%+, weapons, infant formula |
| Placement | No ads on front, back, or roof of vehicle |
| Inside screens | **Not explicitly restricted** |

**Source:** [Điều 29 Luật Quảng cáo 2012](https://adsngoaitroi.vn/quang-cao-tren-taxi-co-can-giay-phep/)

### Advertising Law Summary (Article 32)

- Cannot advertise on front, back, or roof of vehicle
- Cannot exceed 50% of each permitted surface
- **Interior screens not mentioned** = not prohibited

### Driver Distraction Rules

| Rule | Source |
|------|--------|
| No distracting equipment for drivers | Law 23/2008 on Road Traffic |
| Phone use while driving | 4-6M VND fine |
| **Passenger-facing screens** | **Not prohibited** |

**Key insight:** GrabAds and Singapore taxis use **rear-passenger-only screens** specifically to comply with safety rules. This placement is legal and proven.

### 2025 Advertising Law Updates

Law No. 75/2025/QH15 (effective Jan 2026) expands regulation to digital platforms but does not specifically address in-vehicle screens.

## Why No Screens in Vietnam Taxis Today

| Barrier | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **iDOOH died** | Main player went bankrupt 2018-2019 |
| **Taxi industry collapsed** | Traditional taxis lost to Grab/Be |
| **No local player** | No Vietnamese startup filled gap |
| **Low CPM market** | Vietnam rates don't support hardware costs |
| **Driver model** | Individual ownership = no fleet control |
| **No advertiser pull** | Agencies don't ask, suppliers don't build |

### Current State

From [Unique Vietnam](https://uniquevietnam.vn/product/quang-cao-man-hinh-lcd-trong-xe-taxi-o-to/):

> "LCD screen advertising in taxis is a fairly new form... implemented by Mai Linh... but hasn't received much interest from advertisers yet."

**Translation:** Exists in tiny numbers, no scale, no market.

## Invalidated Approaches

### DO NOT REPEAT:

| Approach | Why It Failed | Our Alternative |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Partner with dying taxi company | Mai Linh had $8M debt | Partner with Xanh SM (growing, well-funded) |
| Fund hardware yourself | iDOOH ran out of cash | Xanh SM funds screens |
| Start with 5,000 screens | Too much capital required | Start with 1,000, prove model |
| Rely on driver cooperation | Drivers don't care | Fleet-managed vehicles with accountability |
| No ride data integration | Can't target, can't prove ROI | Xanh SM data for targeting + attribution |
| No self-serve platform | Only serves big brands | Build SME self-serve from day 1 |

---

## What's Different with Xanh SM

| iDOOH + Mai Linh | Our Model + Xanh SM |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Mai Linh: 30% revenue decline, $8M debt | Xanh SM: 32% market share, growing |
| iDOOH funded hardware | Xanh SM funds hardware (40% rev share) |
| No ride data access | Full booking data for targeting |
| 5,000 screens planned | 1,000 MVP, scale to 30,000 |
| Foreign company (Singapore) | Local founder, understands market |
| No advertiser relationships | Target underserved SMEs |
| Relied on agency demand | Build self-serve platform |

---

## Risk Mitigation Lessons

### From iDOOH Failure:

1. **Capital structure** - Don't bear hardware costs alone
2. **Partner health** - Only partner with growing fleets
3. **Driver incentives** - Need accountability, not just subsidies
4. **Market timing** - Traditional taxis are dying, EVs are growing
5. **Advertiser access** - Self-serve for long-tail demand
6. **Attribution** - Must prove ROI with data

### Our Safeguards:

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Xanh SM funds hardware | 40% rev share = they're invested |
| Low fill rate | Hybrid CPM model guarantees minimum |
| Hardware failure | 5% spare pool, maintenance SLA |
| We fail | Xanh SM owns hardware, finds new partner |
| Regulation changes | Passenger-facing precedent (GrabAds, Singapore) |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Regulations are NOT the barrier** - Passenger-facing screens are legal
2. **iDOOH died from capital and execution** - Not market rejection
3. **Mai Linh was the wrong partner** - Sinking ship
4. **Xanh SM is the right partner** - Growing, tech-forward, Vingroup backing
5. **Hardware ownership is key** - Whoever owns screens bears risk
6. **Data integration is essential** - Without it, can't price premium
7. **Self-serve enables scale** - Agency sales alone won't fill inventory
