# Research Summary: Vietnam Taxi DOOH AdTech

**Date:** 11.12.25
**Session Focus:** Revenue modeling, pricing strategy, failure analysis, partnership structuring

---

## Session Overview

This session focused on validating the business model for a taxi DOOH advertising platform in partnership with Xanh SM (Vingroup). We analyzed revenue potential, pricing strategies, historical failures, and the investment case for Xanh SM.

---

## Problem Statement

**Core Problem:** Vietnam's 30,000+ Xanh SM electric taxis represent untapped advertising real estate. No player has successfully deployed in-car screens at scale in Vietnam, despite proven models in Singapore, Indonesia, and Philippines.

**Opportunity:** Partner with Xanh SM to deploy 30K in-car advertising screens, leveraging their ride data for targeting and their capital for hardware investment.

## Hypotheses Tested

### Hypothesis 1: Revenue Model Viability

| Hypothesis | Status | Finding |
|------------|--------|---------|
| 30K screens can generate $8M+ annual revenue at $10 CPM | **VALIDATED** | 180M monthly impressions × 40% fill × $10 CPM = $8.64M/year |
| Unit economics work at 1K screen MVP | **VALIDATED** | Break-even at 7% fill rate; $10K/month profit at 40% fill |
| 60/40 revenue split is sustainable | **VALIDATED** | Your net profit: $3.78M/year after costs |

### Hypothesis 2: Pricing Strategy

| Hypothesis | Status | Finding |
|------------|--------|---------|
| Tiered CPM can serve both enterprise and SMEs | **VALIDATED** | $4-8 (SME) to $20-25 (Enterprise primetime) |
| CPO model is viable for performance advertisers | **PARTIALLY VALIDATED** | Requires QR/promo code infrastructure; pure CPO is risky |
| Hybrid CPM + CPO maximizes fill rate | **VALIDATED** | Base CPM protects revenue; CPO bonus attracts performance buyers |

### Hypothesis 3: Regulatory Barriers

| Hypothesis | Status | Finding |
|------------|--------|---------|
| Regulations block in-car screens | **INVALIDATED** | Passenger-facing screens are legal under Advertising Law 2012 |
| Safety laws prohibit screens | **INVALIDATED** | Only driver-facing screens restricted; headrest placement is safe |
| License required for taxi advertising | **INVALIDATED** | Only notification required (15 days, auto-approved) |

### Hypothesis 4: Historical Failure Causes

| Hypothesis | Status | Finding |
|------------|--------|---------|
| iDOOH failed due to regulations | **INVALIDATED** | Failed due to capital/execution; parent company went bankrupt |
| Mai Linh was viable partner | **INVALIDATED** | Mai Linh had $8M debt, 30% revenue decline when partnership formed |
| Market rejected taxi screens | **INVALIDATED** | No market rejection; initiative died before testing demand |

### Hypothesis 5: Xanh SM Partnership

| Hypothesis | Status | Finding |
|------------|--------|---------|
| Xanh SM is the right partner | **VALIDATED** | #2 market share, growing, well-funded, Vingroup backing |
| 40% rev share covers their investment | **VALIDATED** | $4.26M profit over 3 years on $6.12M investment (70% ROI) |
| Ride data enables premium pricing | **VALIDATED** | Route/audience targeting can increase CPM 50-100% |

## Key Findings

### 1. Revenue Potential

| Phase | Screens | Fill Rate | Annual Net Profit |
|-------|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| MVP | 1,000 | 40% | $120K |
| Scale | 30,000 | 40% | $3.78M |
| Mature | 30,000 | 60% | $6.16M |

**Path to $20M valuation:** Achieved at 30K screens with 40% fill rate (3x revenue multiple).

### 2. Pricing Sweet Spots

| Segment | CPM Range | Target Fill |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Enterprise (primetime) | $15-25 | 20% of inventory |
| Managed SMB | $8-14 | 30% of inventory |
| Self-serve SME | $4-8 | 50% of inventory |
| **Blended** | **$8-10** | **60-70%** |

**Key insight:** SME-heavy mix yields higher total revenue than enterprise-only.

### 3. Why Previous Attempts Failed

| Factor | iDOOH + Mai Linh | Our Model + Xanh SM |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| Partner health | Mai Linh: $8M debt | Xanh SM: $800M revenue, growing |
| Hardware funding | iDOOH funded (burned cash) | Xanh SM funds (40% rev share) |
| Data integration | None | Full ride data access |
| Scale approach | 5,000 screens immediately | 1,000 MVP first |
| Advertiser access | Agency-dependent | Self-serve for SMEs |

### 4. Xanh SM Investment Case

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total investment (3yr) | $6.12M |
| Total return (3yr) | $10.38M |
| Net profit | $4.26M |
| ROI | 70% |
| Payback | 14 months |

**Strategic value:** Competitive differentiation vs Grab, Vingroup ecosystem synergy, data monetization.

### 5. Regulatory Clarity

| Concern | Status | Evidence |
|---------|--------|----------|
| In-car screens legal? | **YES** | Article 32 Advertising Law 2012 |
| License required? | **NO** | Only notification (Article 29) |
| Safety compliance? | **YES** | Passenger-facing (headrest) placement |

## Invalidated Approaches (DO NOT REPEAT)

### 1. Partnering with Struggling Taxi Companies

**What happened:** iDOOH partnered with Mai Linh when they had $8M debt and 30% revenue decline.

**Lesson:** Only partner with growing, well-funded fleets.

**Our approach:** Xanh SM has $800M revenue, 32% market share, Vingroup backing.

### 2. Funding Hardware Yourself

**What happened:** iDOOH burned through $3.88M capital funding screens across 5 markets.

**Lesson:** Hardware capex should be borne by fleet operator.

**Our approach:** Xanh SM funds screens ($3M), receives 40% revenue share.

### 3. Starting Too Big

**What happened:** iDOOH planned 5,000 screens before proving unit economics.

**Lesson:** Validate at small scale first.

**Our approach:** 1,000 screen MVP, scale to 30K only after proving 40% fill rate.

### 4. Relying on Driver Cooperation

**What happened:** Drivers saw screens as burden; no accountability for uptime.

**Lesson:** Need fleet-managed vehicles with accountability.

**Our approach:** Xanh SM's centralized fleet management; screen uptime tied to driver metrics.

### 5. Agency-Only Sales Model

**What happened:** 1,000 screens too small for agencies; no demand.

**Lesson:** Need self-serve platform for long-tail SME demand.

**Our approach:** Build self-serve dashboard from day 1; target local F&B, services.

### 6. No Data Integration

**What happened:** iDOOH screens had no ride data; couldn't target or prove ROI.

**Lesson:** Data integration is essential for premium pricing.

**Our approach:** Full Xanh SM ride data for route/audience targeting; CPV attribution.

## Open Questions for Further Research

1. **Xanh SM data access** - What ride data will they share? Real-time or batch?
2. **Hardware reliability** - What's actual failure rate in Vietnam heat/humidity?
3. **SME willingness to pay** - Will local businesses adopt self-serve?
4. **Programmatic integration** - Can we connect to DV360/TTD for enterprise demand?
5. **Vingroup internal demand** - How much inventory will Vingroup brands absorb?

## Session Conclusion

**Key validation:** The taxi DOOH business model is viable in Vietnam. Regulatory barriers don't exist, and the iDOOH failure was due to poor partner choice and capital structure, not market rejection.

**Critical success factor:** Xanh SM partnership with hardware investment from them. Without this, unit economics are challenging.

**Risk mitigation:** Start with 1K MVP, prove 40% fill rate, then scale. Don't repeat iDOOH's mistake of over-expansion before validation.

**Confidence level:** HIGH for pursuing Xanh SM partnership pitch.
