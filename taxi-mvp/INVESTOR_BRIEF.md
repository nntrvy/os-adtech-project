# Taxi DOOH Network: Feasibility MVP

**Investor Pitch: Technical Validation Phase**

---

## The Opportunity

**50,000 XanhSM taxi vehicles = 50,000 mobile billboards covering Vietnam's highest-value urban areas.**

Market data:
- Vietnam DOOH: $130M → $171M by 2030 (12.54% CAGR)
- Top brands spending: OPPO, Nestle, Heineken, VinFast, Calvin Klein
- Programmatic DOOH showing 61.8% revenue uplift
- 91 of top 100 Vietnam companies invest in DOOH

**The constraint**: Traditional DOOH (billboards, bus stops) is static, expensive, and limited inventory.

**The advantage**: Taxis move through high-traffic commercial zones all day, reaching audiences where they shop and work.

---

## The Risk We're Validating

**Not "will advertisers buy?" (demand exists) but "can we technically execute?"**

Primary technical risks:
1. Can we reliably distribute content to 50,000 moving vehicles?
2. Will hardware survive Vietnam weather + taxi operations?
3. Is 4G connectivity reliable enough for real-time updates?
4. Can we operate with zero manual intervention at scale?

**This MVP validates feasibility, not market demand.**

---

## The MVP: Proof of Technical Execution

### What We're Building (4 Weeks)

**Single feature**: Push static image ads to taxi screens remotely, verify they're displaying.

**Pilot scale**: 50 taxis in HCMC

**Tech stack**:
- Hardware: Android tablets in weatherproof cases
- Connectivity: 4G SIM cards
- Software: Simple polling system (device checks server every 60s)

**What we're NOT building**:
- Video playback
- Programmatic bidding
- Analytics dashboard
- Campaign scheduling
- Multi-advertiser platform

All of that comes AFTER we prove hardware + connectivity works.

---

## Success Criteria (30 Days)

We've validated technical feasibility if:

✅ **80%+ uptime**: Devices report heartbeat at least once per hour
✅ **<10 min update time**: New content reaches 90% of devices within 10 minutes
✅ **<5% hardware failure rate**: Over 30 days of continuous operation
✅ **4G coverage validated**: Works in core HCMC commercial zones
✅ **Zero manual interventions**: No need to physically access taxis to fix issues

If we hit these numbers with 50 taxis, we can confidently scale to 5,000.

## Budget: $15,000 for 4-Week Validation

| Category | Amount | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Hardware (50 units) | $6,500 | Tablets, cases, power, SIM cards |
| Labor | $7,000 | 1 dev, 1 ops person |
| Contingency | $1,500 | Replacements, fixes |
| **Total** | **$15,000** | ~$300/taxi for 30-day test |

At scale (5,000+ units), cost drops to ~$80/taxi with custom hardware manufacturing.

## Revenue Model (Post-Validation)

Once validated, here's the path to revenue:

### Phase 1: Direct Sales (Month 2-6)
- Approach top 20 DOOH advertisers directly
- Sell fixed-price campaigns: $5,000/week for 1,000 taxis
- Target: 10 brands × 4 campaigns/mo = $200k/mo revenue

### Phase 2: Self-Serve Platform (Month 6-12)
- Build advertiser dashboard
- Enable online booking + payment
- Target: 50 brands × $2,000/mo avg = $100k/mo recurring

### Phase 3: Programmatic (Month 12+)
- Integrate with Vietnamese ad exchanges
- OpenRTB bidding protocol
- Target: $1-2 CPM, 50k taxis, 8 hrs/day, 1 ad/min = $15-30M/year

### Unit Economics (at scale):
- **Hardware cost**: $80/taxi (one-time)
- **Operating cost**: $5/taxi/month (4G data)
- **Revenue potential**: $30-50/taxi/month (conservative)
- **Gross margin**: 80-85%

---

## Competitive Landscape

**Traditional DOOH (billboards)**:
- Static locations
- High cost ($2,000-10,000/month per billboard)
- Limited inventory
- No real-time updates

**Digital DOOH (screens in malls, airports)**:
- Fixed locations
- Expensive infrastructure
- Requires venue partnerships

**Taxi DOOH (us)**:
- **Mobile**: Cover entire city
- **Low cost**: 10x cheaper than billboards
- **Real-time**: Update content instantly
- **Exclusive**: 50,000 vehicle distribution advantage

**Key differentiator**: We have exclusive access to 50,000 vehicles. Competitors would need years to build equivalent distribution.

---

## Why This Can Work

### 1. Distribution Advantage
- 50,000 taxis = largest mobile DOOH network in Vietnam
- Taxis naturally cluster in high-value commercial zones
- HCMC + Hanoi = 60-70% of national DOOH spending

### 2. Technical Feasibility
- Simple technology (Android tablets + 4G)
- Proven model: Grab has screens in 10,000+ cars in SEA
- Vietnam 4G coverage: 95%+ in urban areas

### 3. Market Timing
- Programmatic DOOH growing globally
- Vietnamese brands increasing digital ad spend
- Traditional media declining

### 4. Clear Path to Scale
- Validate: 50 taxis in 4 weeks ($15k)
- Launch: 1,000 taxis in 3 months ($80k hardware)
- Scale: 10,000 taxis in 12 months ($800k hardware)
- Full deployment: 50,000 taxis in 24 months

## What We Need from This Investment

**For feasibility validation ($15k)**:
- Prove hardware survives Vietnam conditions
- Prove 4G connectivity is reliable
- Prove remote content distribution works
- Demonstrate to first advertiser

**Next round (if validated) ($300k)**:
- Custom hardware manufacturing (1,000 units)
- Build advertiser platform
- Sales team (2 people)
- Scale to 1,000 taxis

**Series A (if traction) ($2-5M)**:
- Full fleet deployment (50,000 units)
- Programmatic integration
- Regional expansion (Thailand, Indonesia)

---

## Timeline

**Week 1-4**: Feasibility MVP
**Week 5-8**: First paid campaign with local brand
**Week 9-16**: Scale to 1,000 taxis, build advertiser platform
**Week 17-52**: Scale to 10,000 taxis, launch programmatic

---

## Why We'll Win

1. **Unfair advantage**: Exclusive access to 50,000 vehicles
2. **Lean execution**: Validate with $15k in 4 weeks, not $500k in 6 months
3. **Proven team**: [Your background in adtech/Vietnam market]
4. **Clear monetization**: Existing market, proven demand
5. **Defensible moat**: Once installed, hard for competitors to replicate

---

## The Ask

**$15,000 for 4-week technical validation.**

In 30 days, you'll know if this is technically feasible. If we hit success criteria, we move to full deployment. If not, we've learned for minimal cost.

**Decision point**: Week 4 results determine if we proceed to $300k raise for 1,000-taxi launch.

---

## Questions We'll Answer

By end of Week 4:

✅ Does hardware survive taxi operations?
✅ Is 4G reliable enough for real-time updates?
✅ Can we operate with zero manual intervention?
✅ What's the real uptime/reliability at scale?
✅ What's actual cost per taxi?
✅ Will advertisers pay for this inventory?

**Low risk, high learning.**

## Appendix: Comparable Companies

**Grab**: In-car screens in 10,000+ vehicles across SEA (ride-hailing context)
**Firefly**: Taxi-top LED screens in US (hardware-focused, not programmatic)
**Wrapify**: Car wrap advertising in US (static wraps, not digital)
**Adomni**: Programmatic DOOH platform (software, not inventory owner)

**Key difference**: We own both the exclusive distribution AND the technology platform.
