# Vietnam Taxi & Ride-Hailing Advertising: Competitive Analysis

**Date:** 11.12.25
**Focus:** Comprehensive analysis of existing taxi/ride-hailing advertising solutions in Vietnam

---

## Executive Summary

Vietnam's taxi advertising market is dominated by **decal/wrap advertising** with limited digital screen adoption. The market is fragmented across multiple agencies and taxi operators. **In-car LCD screen advertising is nascent** - only Vinasun has meaningful deployment (1,500 screens) but focuses on basic TVC playback without programmatic capabilities.

**Key Finding:** No player offers programmatic in-car digital advertising in Vietnam. This represents a significant gap for a Xanh SM partnership.

## Gap Analysis

### What Exists in Vietnam

| Capability | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Decal/wrap advertising | ✅ Mature market |
| In-app advertising (Grab) | ✅ Available |
| Basic LCD screens (Vinasun) | ⚠️ Limited (1,500 screens) |
| Programmatic in-car ads | ❌ **Does not exist** |
| Data-driven targeting | ❌ **Does not exist** |
| Self-serve platform | ❌ **Does not exist** |
| CPM/CPO pricing | ❌ **Does not exist** |
| SME-accessible digital | ❌ **Does not exist** |

### What Our Xanh SM Model Offers

| Capability | Our Advantage |
|------------|---------------|
| Fleet size | 30,000 screens (vs Vinasun 1,500) |
| Screen placement | Headrest (eye-level) vs ceiling |
| Targeting | Route + audience data from Xanh SM |
| Pricing | CPM, CPO, CPV options |
| Self-serve | Platform for SMEs |
| Programmatic | Future integration (DV360, TTD) |
| Data integration | Ride booking data for attribution |

---

## Competitive Positioning

### Direct Competitors

| Competitor | Threat Level | Why |
|------------|--------------|-----|
| Vinasun LCD | **Medium** | Only current LCD player, but limited scale and no targeting |
| GrabAds (future) | **High** | If Grab deploys screens in Vietnam, they have massive scale |
| MediaDonuts | **Low** | Sales partner only, no infrastructure |

### Indirect Competitors

| Competitor | Threat Level | Why |
|------------|--------------|-----|
| Decal agencies | **Low** | Different format, lower engagement |
| In-app ads (Grab, Be) | **Medium** | Compete for same budgets |
| Billboards/LED | **Low** | Fixed locations, different use case |

### Our Moat

1. **First mover on Xanh SM** - Exclusive partnership
2. **Scale** - 30K screens vs 1.5K (Vinasun)
3. **Data integration** - Ride data enables targeting no one else has
4. **Modern EV fleet** - Premium perception
5. **Headrest placement** - Better viewing angle than ceiling
6. **Self-serve** - Captures SME long-tail demand

---

## Strategic Recommendations

### 1. Differentiate from Vinasun

| Vinasun | Our Model |
|---------|-----------|
| 1,500 screens | 30,000 screens |
| Ceiling-mounted | Headrest-mounted |
| Basic TVC playback | Dynamic, targeted content |
| No data | Ride data integration |
| Agency sales only | Self-serve + enterprise |

### 2. Pre-empt GrabAds

GrabAds could deploy in-car screens in Vietnam. Move fast to:
- Lock in Xanh SM exclusivity
- Build advertiser relationships
- Establish self-serve platform
- Create switching costs

### 3. Price Competitively

| Format | Market Rate | Our Target |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Decal (4-door) | $110-160/mo | N/A (different format) |
| LCD screen | ~$120-200/mo (Vinasun) | $200-400/mo (30K inventory) |
| CPM | N/A | $6-25 (tiered) |
| CPO | N/A | $2-10 |

### 4. Target Underserved Segments

Current market serves:
- Big brands (via agencies)
- Multi-month campaigns
- Minimum 50-100 vehicle buys

We should target:
- **SMEs** (self-serve, low minimums)
- **Performance advertisers** (CPO model)
- **Local businesses** (geo-targeted)

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **No programmatic in-car advertising exists in Vietnam** - Major gap
2. **Vinasun is only LCD player** with 1,500 screens (our 30K = 20x)
3. **Market is agency-dominated** - No self-serve options
4. **Decal is mature** - Digital screens are nascent
5. **GrabAds has not deployed screens in Vietnam** - Window of opportunity
6. **Data integration is unique** - No competitor has ride data

**Bottom Line:** The competitive landscape is favorable. No one offers what we're building. The key is to move fast before GrabAds potentially enters with in-car screens.
