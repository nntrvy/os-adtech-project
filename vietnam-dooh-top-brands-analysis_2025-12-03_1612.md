### Key Pain Points and Unsolved Needs

These major advertisers, despite their significant investment, face several common challenges in the Vietnamese DOOH landscape. Their unsolved needs primarily revolve around bringing the data-driven precision of digital advertising to the physical world.

**1. Lack of Standardized and Reliable Measurement**

*   **Pain Point**: Brands are accustomed to the granular analytics of online advertising (clicks, conversions, real-time dashboards). In contrast, DOOH in Vietnam relies heavily on older methods like traffic counts, which provide estimated impressions but little else. This makes it difficult to calculate a clear Return on Investment (ROI).
*   **Unsolved Need**: A unified, cross-network measurement platform that provides standardized metrics for:
    *   **Verified Impressions**: Beyond estimates, knowing how many people actually saw the ad.
    *   **Audience Demographics**: Real data on the age, gender, and interests of the audience.
    *   **Attribution**: Connecting ad exposure to business outcomes, such as foot traffic to a retail store, website visits, or an increase in sales in a specific area.

**2. Fragmented and Inefficient Buying Process**

*   **Pain Point**: The DOOH market is fragmented with numerous vendors, each with their own inventory, pricing, and booking processes. Planning a national or even a multi-district city campaign requires contacting and negotiating with multiple individual suppliers, which is time-consuming and inefficient.
*   **Unsolved Need**: A centralized marketplace or platform that allows media buyers to:
    *   **View Available Inventory**: See all available screens from multiple vendors in one place.
    *   **Streamline Booking**: Plan and book campaigns across different networks with a single interface.
    *   **Transparent Pricing**: Access clear, comparable pricing information.

**3. Limited Programmatic and Real-Time Capabilities**

*   **Pain Point**: Digital-first brands like Grab and Samsung want to leverage the agility of programmatic buying—automating ad purchases based on real-time data. The majority of DOOH inventory in Vietnam is still sold directly, lacking the infrastructure for real-time bidding (RTB).
*   **Unsolved Need**: Wider adoption of programmatic DOOH (pDOOH) platforms that enable:
    *   **Real-Time Bidding**: The ability to bid on ad slots automatically.
    *   **Dynamic Creative Optimization (DCO)**: Changing the ad creative in real-time based on triggers like weather, time of day, or local events. For example, Coca-Cola could show an ad for a cold drink on a hot day.
    *   **Hyper-local Targeting**: Serving different ads to different screens based on the specific audience at that location.

**4. Difficulty in Achieving True Audience-Based Targeting**

*   **Pain Point**: Targeting in DOOH is still largely location-based (e.g., "target this busy intersection"). Brands want to target based on audience behavior and demographics, not just geography. An automotive brand like VinFast wants to reach high-income individuals, not just everyone who passes a certain billboard.
*   **Unsolved Need**: Data integration solutions that allow for more sophisticated audience targeting by layering multiple data sources:
    *   **Mobile Data**: Using anonymized mobile location data to understand audience movement patterns and interests.
    *   **Third-Party Data**: Integrating data from other sources (e.g., loyalty programs, credit card usage) to build richer audience profiles.

**5. Inconsistent Creative and Technical Standards**

*   **Pain Point**: Each DOOH network may have slightly different technical specifications for screen size, resolution, and file formats. This forces creative teams to produce multiple versions of the same ad, adding complexity and cost.
*   **Unsolved Need**: Industry-wide standardization of creative specifications to simplify the ad creation and deployment process, making it as easy as submitting a single ad for an online campaign.

In summary, major brands are eager to invest in Vietnamese DOOH, but they are held back by a lack of the data, efficiency, and targeting capabilities they take for granted in the online advertising world. The provider that can solve these core issues will unlock significant new spending.
