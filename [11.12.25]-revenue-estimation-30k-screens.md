**Session:** Revenue modeling for Xanh SM partnership

---

## Executive Summary

This document estimates revenue potential for a taxi DOOH advertising platform with 30,000 in-car screens, partnered with Xanh SM (Vingroup's electric taxi service). The model assumes GSM/Xanh SM invests in hardware while we operate the ad platform.

## Key Assumptions

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Screens | 30,000 | Xanh SM fleet size |
| CPM | $10 | Base price per 1,000 impressions |
| Revenue share to Xanh SM | 40% | Covers their screen investment |
| Daily impressions per screen | 200 | Conservative estimate |
| Operating model | Programmatic + Direct sales | Targeting SMEs/local businesses |

---

## Impressions Calculation

**Per Screen Daily Impressions:**
- Average rides/taxi/day: 15-20 rides (Vietnam taxi market)
- Passengers per ride: 1.5 avg
- Ad slots per ride: 8-12 (typical 15-20 min ride, 15-sec ads)
- **Daily impressions per screen: ~180-300**

Using **200 impressions/screen/day** (conservative)

**Monthly Fleet Impressions:**
```
30,000 screens × 200 impressions × 30 days = 180,000,000 impressions/month
```
