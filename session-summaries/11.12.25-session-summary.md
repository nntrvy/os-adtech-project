# Session Summary - 11.12.25

## Session Overview
- **Duration**: ~2 hours
- **Primary Focus**: Revenue modeling, pricing strategy, failure analysis, Xanh SM partnership structuring
- **Key Outcome**: Validated business model economics; identified why iDOOH/Mai Linh failed (execution, not regulations); built comprehensive Xanh SM investment case

## Findings & Discoveries

### Revenue Model Validation
- **MVP (1K screens)**: $10K/month profit at 40% fill rate; break-even at just 7% fill
- **Scale (30K screens)**: $315K/month profit ($3.78M/year) at 40% fill rate
- **$20M Valuation**: Achievable at 30K screens with 40% fill (3x revenue multiple)
- **Unit Economics**: Costs scale sub-linearly (22-36x) while revenue scales linearly (30x)

### Pricing Strategy Development
- **Three-Tier CPM Model**: Self-serve SME ($4-8), Managed SMB ($8-14), Enterprise ($12-25)
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Primetime (5-9PM) commands 2x+ premium over night slots
- **Hybrid CPM + CPO**: Base CPM protects revenue; CPO bonus attracts performance buyers
- **CPV (Cost Per Visit)**: Unique Xanh SM data advantage - track dropoffs near advertiser locations
- **Optimal Mix**: SME-heavy (50% self-serve) yields highest total revenue via higher fill rate

### Critical Failure Analysis (Mai Linh + iDOOH)
- **iDOOH Status**: Dissolved via creditors' voluntary winding up (~2019)
- **Root Cause 1**: Mai Linh was dying - $8M debt, 30% revenue decline when partnership formed
- **Root Cause 2**: iDOOH funded hardware themselves - burned through $3.88M capital
- **Root Cause 3**: Started too big - 5,000 screens planned before proving unit economics
- **Root Cause 4**: No data integration - couldn't target or prove ROI
- **Root Cause 5**: Driver incentive problem - screens seen as burden, not benefit

### Regulatory Clarity (Key Validation)
- **In-car screens are LEGAL**: Article 32, Advertising Law 2012
- **No license required**: Only notification (Article 29) - 15 days, auto-approved if no response
- **Safety compliant**: Passenger-facing (headrest) placement doesn't distract drivers
- **Conclusion**: iDOOH failed due to execution and economics, NOT regulations

### Xanh SM Investment Case
- **Fleet**: 30,000+ EVs (perfect match for screen deployment)
- **Market Position**: #2 in Vietnam (32% share), only behind Grab
- **2024 Revenue**: 20,000+ billion VND (~$800M)
- **Investment Required**: $6.12M over 3 years ($3M hardware + $1.04M/year operations)
- **Return**: $10.38M over 3 years (40% of gross revenue)
- **Net Profit**: $4.26M (70% ROI)
- **Payback Period**: 14 months

### Hardware Sourcing
- **Tablet Cost**: $60-80/unit for 10.1" Android 4G tablets (Alibaba/Made-in-China)
- **Full Kit Cost**: ~$100/screen including mount, cables, installation
- **Suppliers**: Shenzhen Touchwo, Shanghai Jannu, Shenzhen Portworld
- **Bulk Order (30K)**: Expect $60-70/unit

## Hypotheses Tested

### Validated
| Hypothesis | Evidence |
|------------|----------|
| 30K screens can generate $8M+ annual revenue | 180M impressions × 40% fill × $10 CPM = $8.64M |
| Unit economics work at 1K MVP | Break-even at 7% fill; profitable from day 1 |
| Tiered CPM can serve SME to Enterprise | $4-25 range covers noodle shop to Coca-Cola |
| Regulations don't block in-car screens | Article 32 Advertising Law 2012 - legal |
| Xanh SM is viable partner | Growing, well-funded, Vingroup backing |
| 40% rev share covers Xanh SM investment | 70% ROI, 14-month payback |

### Invalidated (DO NOT REPEAT)
| Approach | Why It Failed | Our Alternative |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Partner with struggling taxi company | Mai Linh had $8M debt | Xanh SM: $800M revenue, growing |
| Fund hardware yourself | iDOOH burned $3.88M | Xanh SM funds (40% rev share) |
| Start with 5,000 screens | Too much capital at risk | 1,000 screen MVP first |
| Rely on driver cooperation alone | No accountability | Fleet-managed with metrics |
| Agency-only sales | Small inventory unattractive | Self-serve platform for SMEs |
| No data integration | Can't target or prove ROI | Full Xanh SM ride data access |

## Decisions Made

### Business Model
1. **Revenue Share Model**: 60/40 split (us/Xanh SM) is sustainable
2. **Xanh SM Funds Hardware**: They bear capex risk, we operate platform
3. **Hybrid Pricing**: CPM base + CPO/CPV performance bonus
4. **SME Focus**: Self-serve platform critical for fill rate

### Pricing Strategy
1. **Three Tiers**: Self-serve ($4-8), Managed ($8-14), Enterprise ($12-25)
2. **Dynamic by Time**: Primetime 2x+ premium
3. **Target Blended CPM**: $8-10 with 60-70% fill rate
4. **CPV Unique Advantage**: Xanh SM data enables foot traffic attribution

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Start Small**: 1,000 screens MVP before 30K scale
2. **Prove 40% Fill**: Scale trigger is validated fill rate
3. **Hybrid Protects Both Sides**: Base revenue guaranteed, bonus on performance

## Open Questions (For Future Sessions)

### Partnership
1. Who is the Xanh SM decision-maker for advertising partnerships?
2. What ride data will Xanh SM share? Real-time or batch?
3. Will Vingroup brands absorb internal inventory?

### Technical
1. What's actual hardware failure rate in Vietnam heat/humidity?
2. Best remote monitoring platform for 4G Android tablets?
3. Can we connect to programmatic (DV360/TTD) for enterprise demand?

### Commercial
1. Will Vietnamese SMEs adopt self-serve platform?
2. What's competitive driver incentive in Vietnam market?
3. Partnership model with other fleets (Mai Linh, Vinasun) after Xanh SM?
