## Decisions Made

### Strategic Direction
1. **Passenger-Facing Screens Are Safe**: Confirmed headrest-mounted, rear-passenger-only screens solve all driver distraction concerns
2. **Static Images First**: GrabAds started with images before video - validates our MVP approach
3. **Manual Upload Initially**: Self-serve platforms take years to develop (GrabAds took 5 years) - manual upload is appropriate for MVP
4. **Driver Opt-In Model**: 10% income boost is proven incentive structure

### Technical Validation
1. **60s Polling Works**: GrabAds uses similar polling approach for content distribution
2. **Content Caching Required**: Offline playback during connectivity outages is critical
3. **Remote Monitoring Needed**: Track device health from day one
4. **Kiosk Mode Essential**: Prevent passenger tampering with system

### Safety Requirements (Non-Negotiable)
1. **Screen Placement**: Back of front seat headrest, facing rear passengers ONLY
2. **Professional Installation**: Required for insurance compliance and airbag safety
3. **No Driver-Audible Audio**: Passenger volume control with mute option mandatory
4. **Content Approval Process**: Build early to prepare for future regulations
