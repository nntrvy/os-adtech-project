## CPO (Cost Per Order) Models

### The Attribution Challenge

| Platform | Can Track Orders? | How |
|----------|-------------------|-----|
| GrabAds | Yes | Closed ecosystem |
| Meta/Google | Yes | Pixel tracking |
| Taxi Screen | **No direct link** | Need attribution infrastructure |

### Model 1: QR Code Attribution

```
Screen shows ad with unique QR code
→ Passenger scans QR
→ Lands on order page (with tracking UTM)
→ Completes order
→ You charge per order
```

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| QR scan rate | 0.5-2% of impressions |
| Scan-to-order rate | 10-30% |
| Effective conversion | 0.05-0.6% |
| CPO price | $2-10 per order |

### Model 2: Promo Code Attribution

```
Screen shows: "Use code TAXI20 for 20% off"
→ Passenger orders via any channel
→ Uses promo code
→ Advertiser reports redemptions
→ You charge per redemption
```

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Code redemption rate | 0.1-0.5% |
| CPO price | $1-5 per redemption |

### Model 3: Hybrid CPM + CPO (Recommended)

| Component | Pricing | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Base CPM | $3-5 | Covers inventory cost |
| CPO bonus | $1-3 per order | Performance upside |

**Example: Restaurant chain**
```
Base: 100,000 impressions × $4 CPM = $400
Bonus: 50 tracked orders × $2 CPO = $100
Total: $500
Effective CPM: $5 (if orders happen)
```

### Model 4: CPV (Cost Per Visit) - Using Xanh SM Data

**Unique advantage with Xanh SM partnership:**

```
Passenger sees ad for Restaurant X
→ Taxi drops passenger within 200m of Restaurant X
→ Xanh SM ride data shows: ad shown → dropoff at restaurant
→ Attribute as "foot traffic conversion"
→ Charge CPV
```

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| CPV price | $0.50-2.00 per verified visit |
| Attribution window | 24 hours |
| Works for | Any offline business |

## CPO Rate Card by Business Type

| Business Type | CPO Range | Equiv. CPM | Method |
|---------------|-----------|------------|--------|
| F&B (online) | $2-4 | $4-8 | QR → order |
| F&B (offline) | $1-2 | $3-6 | Promo code |
| Retail | $3-6 | $6-12 | QR → purchase |
| Services | $5-15 | $8-20 | Booking code |
| Apps | $3-8/install | $10-25 | Attribution SDK |
| E-commerce | 5-10% of order | Variable | Affiliate link |

## Fill Rate Optimization

### Waterfall Pricing

```
Priority 1: Enterprise (primetime, premium CPM)
     ↓ unsold
Priority 2: Managed (standard + off-peak)
     ↓ unsold
Priority 3: Self-serve (fills gaps)
     ↓ unsold
Priority 4: House ads / PSAs (0% waste)
```

### Programmatic Floor Prices

| Inventory Type | Floor CPM | Ceiling CPM |
|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| Primetime + Premium Route | $15 | $25 |
| Primetime + Standard | $12 | $20 |
| Daytime + Premium Route | $10 | $15 |
| Daytime + Standard | $6 | $12 |
| Night + Any | $3 | $8 |

|---------|-------------|-----|---------|
| Enterprise | 30M | $18 | $540K |
| Managed | 25M | $10 | $250K |
| Self-serve | 15M | $6 | $90K |

| Self-serve | 45M | $6 | $270K |
| **Total** | **110M (61%)** | **$10.2** | **$1.12M** |

### Scenario C: SME Heavy (Recommended)
| Segment | Impressions | CPM | Revenue |
|---------|-------------|-----|---------|
| Enterprise | 15M | $18 | $270K |
| Managed | 45M | $10 | $450K |
| Self-serve | 80M | $6 | $480K |
| **Total** | **140M (78%)** | **$8.6** | **$1.2M** |

**Optimal: Scenario C** - Higher fill rate = more total revenue despite lower CPM.

## Mechanics to Maximize Fill Rate

### 1. Unsold Inventory Auction
Last 24 hours → open to programmatic at reduced floor

### 2. Happy Hour Pricing
Night inventory (9PM-6AM) at 50% off

### 3. Commitment Discounts
| Contract | Discount |
|----------|----------|
| 1 month | 0% |
| 3 months | 10% |
| 6 months | 15% |
| 12 months | 20% |

### 4. Volume Bonuses
| Monthly Spend | Bonus |
|---------------|-------|
| 100M+ VND | +5% free |
| 500M+ VND | +10% free |
| 1B+ VND | +15% free |

### 5. First-Time Advertiser Credit
- New SME signup: 2M VND free credit
- Lowers barrier, fills off-peak

---

## Example: Noodle Shop (10M VND/month)

**Hybrid Model:**
- Base: $3 CPM → 50,000 impressions = $150
- Performance: $2.50/order via promo code
- If 100 orders → $150 + $250 = $400 total
- If 50 orders → $150 + $125 = $275 (minimum protected)
- If 200 orders → $150 + $500 = $650 (bonus!)

**Pitch:**
> "Pay 3.75M VND base for 50,000 impressions. Every customer who uses code PHOGA20 costs you only 62,500 VND extra. You only pay more if it's working."

---

## Example: Coca-Cola (2B VND/month)

| Campaign | Model | Metric |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Brand awareness | CPM $18 | 4.4M impressions |
| Circle K promo | CPV $1.50 | Dropoffs near Circle K |
| GrabMart conversion | CPA $5 | Orders via GrabMart link |

**Hybrid deal:**
- 3M impressions at $15 CPM = $45,000 (guaranteed)
- 20,000 verified store visits at $1.50 = $30,000 (performance)
- 1,000 GrabMart orders at $5 = $5,000 (performance)
- **Total: $80,000** with attribution on 50% of spend

## Infrastructure Requirements

| Feature | Priority | Cost | Enables |
|---------|----------|------|---------|
| QR code generator | High | $2K | Basic CPO |
| Promo code dashboard | High | $5K | Offline CPO |
| UTM tracking | High | $1K | Attribution |
| Landing page builder | Medium | $10K | Better conversion |
| Xanh SM data integration | High | $20K | CPV (foot traffic) |
| Delivery app API | Low | $30K+ | True CPO |

**MVP build: $8K** (QR + promo codes + UTM)

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Don't go pure CPO** - Leaves money on table when campaigns work
2. **Hybrid protects both sides** - Base revenue + performance upside
3. **SME-heavy mix = highest fill rate** - Long-tail demand
4. **Xanh SM data enables CPV** - Unique attribution without app
5. **Target blended CPM: $8-10** with 60-70% fill rate
