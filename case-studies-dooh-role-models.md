## 1. Screenverse + SOMO (NYC, USA)
### The Programmatic Monetization Partner Model

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Structure** | 4-party: Fleet (MTBOT) + Tech (Ara Labs) + OOH Operator (GPO Vallas) + Programmatic (Screenverse) |
| **Scale** | 4,000 screens, 3B monthly impressions, 65% NYC market share |
| **Tech** | GPS geotargeting, weather triggers, SSP integrations (Vistar, Hivestack, Place Exchange, Broadsign) |
| **Differentiator** | Sustainability (hybrid fleet, TiO2 air-purifying screens) |
| **Audience** | 50% ages 18-35, 60% have $100K+ annual income |

### Partnership Structure
- **SOMO** — Brand name for NYC's largest digital taxi-top network
- **GPO Vallas** — Leading Latin American OOH company (launched SOMO as U.S. business)
- **Ara Labs** — Technology provider and hardware owner (backed by Founders Fund, Coatue)
- **MTBOT** — Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade (5,500 taxicabs)
- **Screenverse** — Exclusive programmatic monetization partner

### Technology Capabilities
- Two-sided LED displays with auto-brightness
- Real-time content updates and dynamic creative optimization
- Day-parting, neighborhood-level targeting
- Weather-triggered content

### Business Model
