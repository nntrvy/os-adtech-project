# GrabAds In-Cabin Screens & Taxi Screen Safety Research

**Source:** Deep research via web search (42+ sources)
**Created:** 2025-12-09
**Purpose:** Engineering and safety reference for Vietnam Taxi DOOH MVP

## Executive Summary

This document compiles research on:
1. **GrabAds in-cabin screen implementation** - How Southeast Asia's largest ride-hailing advertising platform operates
2. **Taxi screen safety concerns** - Regulations, best practices, and the critical distinction between passenger-facing vs. driver-facing screens

**Key Finding:** The infotainment/driver distraction concern is solved by **passenger-only facing screens**. All successful taxi screen deployments (NYC, Singapore, GrabAds) use headrest-mounted or partition-mounted screens that are invisible to the driver.

## Part 2: Taxi Screen Safety & Driver Distraction

### The Core Problem: Driver Distraction

**The Risk is Real**
- Distraction higher among taxi drivers (score 2.82) vs. private drivers (2.32)
- Taxi drivers have 31.8% probability of using electronic devices vs. other drivers
- 3,275 deaths from distracted driving in US (2023)
- 12% of fatal crashes involved cell phone use

**Three Types of Distraction**
1. **Visual** - Taking eyes off road
2. **Manual** - Taking hands off wheel
3. **Cognitive** - Taking mind off driving

### The Solution: Passenger-Only Facing Screens

**Critical Distinction**
| Screen Type | Safety Status |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Passenger-facing (headrest/partition)** | Safe - used globally |
| **Driver-facing (dashboard/windshield)** | Dangerous - prohibited |
| **Infotainment systems** | No-go for taxi advertising |

**Why Passenger-Facing Works**
- Driver cannot see content → no visual distraction
- No interaction required from driver → no manual distraction
- Driver focus remains on road → no cognitive distraction

### Safe Implementation Patterns

#### 1. Headrest-Mounted Screens (Recommended)

**Best Practices**
- Mount on back of front seat headrest, facing rear passengers
- Never use rigid fixings (must be flexible)
- Never remove headrests (safety critical)
- Must not interfere with airbag deployment
- Must not prevent seatbelt operation
- Professional installation recommended

**Mounting Systems**
- Universal mounts attach to headrest poles
- 360° swivel for horizontal/vertical positioning
- Locking mechanisms to deter theft
- Anti-vibration features

#### 2. Partition-Mounted Screens

**Physical Requirements**
- Mount on protective partition between driver and passenger
- Must not obstruct driver's rear vision
- Must include opening for payment transactions
- D.C. requirements: Coverage with gaps no larger than 4 inches

#### 3. Hardware Safety Features

**Essential Features**
| Feature | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Auto-brightness | Adjust for ambient light (dim at night) |
| Kiosk mode | Prevent passenger tampering |
| Auto-start/shutdown | Tied to vehicle ignition |
| Content caching | Play during connectivity outages |
| Remote monitoring | Track device health |

### Audio Considerations

**Key Rules**
- Passenger-controlled volume (mute option required)
- **No audio audible to driver** - critical for safety
- Headphone jack/Bluetooth for passenger audio
- Auto-mute or low default volume

**Legal Context**
- Illegal to drive with headphones in both ears in: Alaska, California, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Rhode Island, Virginia, Washington
- Driver should hear only navigation/GPS and critical vehicle sounds

### Industry Examples

#### NYC Taxi TV (Verifone/CMT)
- Introduced 2006, installed in 13,587 taxis
- Backseat screens with entertainment, GPS map, payment
- TLC mandated Passenger Information Monitors (2008)
- Position: Backseat only (passenger-facing)
- Content: NBCUniversal (Verifone), ABC (CMT)

#### Singapore (ComfortDelGro/Moove Media)
- Interactive screens in 3,000 taxis
- Geo-fenced advertising capabilities
- **Controversial feature:** Cannot turn off until journey ends
- Passengers can silence but playback auto-resumes after 30 seconds

#### Singapore Taxi Top (External)
- **Critical safety feature:** Ad transitions only when taxi is stationary
- Each ad plays 15 seconds before transition
- LTA (Land Transport Authority) approved

### Content Restrictions

**Prohibited Content (NYC TLC Guidelines)**
- Political advertising
- Illegal activities
- Discrimination or hate speech
- Offensive or inappropriate content

**Required**
- TLC/local authority approval for all content
- Compliance with local advertising standards
- Vehicle owner can object to content

## Part 3: Vietnam-Specific Regulations

### Ministry of Transport Regulations

**Decree 10/2020 (Effective January 17, 2020)**
- Governs ride-hailing platforms including Grab
- **Camera requirement:** Must record driver and car doors (effective July 2021)
- Taxi identification: Rooftop light boxes (12×30 cm) OR reflective "XE TAXI" windshield stickers

**Proposed Expansion (November 2025 Draft Law)**
- May require passenger compartment image recording
- Minister of Public Security: "All relevant data will be protected according to the law"
- Some National Assembly deputies expressed privacy concerns

### Current Taxi Company Implementations

**VinaSun Taxi**
- Fleet with LCD screens and sound systems
- **1,500+ TV screens** distributed across districts
- Over 3,500 vehicles in HCMC
- Accepts advertising partnerships
- Already running video commercials (TVCs)

**Mai Linh Taxi**
- LCD-equipped vehicles in some fleet
- Accepts advertising partnerships
- App-based bookings available

**Existing Advertising Formats in Vietnam**
1. Exterior: Rear quarter glass, back glass, side doors
2. Interior:
   - Hanging bags with flyers
   - Advertising posters
   - **TV screens with 5, 10, 15-minute TVCs**

### Gap in Regulations

**No explicit Vietnamese regulations found for:**
- Screen placement to prevent driver distraction
- Content restrictions for in-cabin advertising
- Mandatory safety features (auto-pause, brightness limits)
- Differentiation between passenger-facing vs. driver-facing displays

**Implication:** Vietnam currently relies on general traffic safety laws and operator discretion.
