## Risk Analysis

### Risks for Xanh SM

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Low fill rate | Medium | Revenue below projection | Hybrid CPM model, SME self-serve |
| We fail to execute | Low | Hardware stranded | Xanh SM owns assets, finds new partner |
| Regulation change | Very Low | Forced removal | Passenger-facing is legal precedent |
| Hardware theft/damage | Medium | Replacement cost | 5% spare pool, maintenance SLA |

### Why Risk is Acceptable

1. **$3M is 0.4% of Xanh SM's revenue** - Immaterial if total loss
2. **Hardware has residual value** - Can repurpose or sell
3. **Proven model globally** - Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia
4. **14-month payback** - Quick return on investment
5. **Vingroup ecosystem** - Can fill inventory internally if needed
